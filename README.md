#TeamFIT
## group fitness tracking application

For more information about the development of the app, please visit http://cs.wellesley.edu/~teamfit/index.html

There are many fitness tracking apps available to mobile users. However, many of them tend to focus on tracking individual fitness. TeamFit takes advantage of a team environment to motivate individuals on a sports team to stay fit and provide organization and transparency when organizing off-season workouts/exercises. The focus of the application will be holding people accountable in a fun, encouraging, and ultimately, united team experience.
